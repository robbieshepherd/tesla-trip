Tesla Trip
=====

A small daemon and web view to track the progression of my Model S up the East Coast using the Tesla Supercharger network.
Connects to the [Tesla API](https://github.com/timdorr/model-s-api) that I happened to reverse engineer. Streams data to
Tempo DB for storage and displays on a Mapbox map.
